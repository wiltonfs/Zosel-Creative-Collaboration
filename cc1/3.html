<b>Pine Tree Dreams</b><br><br>

She woke up from her dream and knew,<br>
she had to find the place.<br>
Where she had felt her soul at peace,<br>
and gazed up into space.<br>
She hopped on a bus and followed her gut,<br>
To a sleepy Oregon road.<br>
And there she breathed a silent prayer,<br>
Just like her dream had showed:<br><br>

<i>It was 1.7 acres<br>
You could sometimes smell the sea<br>
And on the right, beside the fence<br>
Grew that pair of old pine trees</i><br><br>

She knew she had to have it,<br>
but she didn't have the cash.<br>
So she walked dogs for a New York banker,<br>
And dug graves, and sold potash,<br>
She gut fish in Ketchikan,<br>
And sung in Wyoming<br>
When her knuckles bled or her face burnt,<br>
She remembered her dream.<br><br>

<i>It was 1.7 acres<br>
You could sometimes smell the sea<br>
And on the right, beside the fence<br>
Grew that pair of old pine trees</i><br><br>

When she'd finally earned enough,<br>
she hurried to the coast<br>
And down that quiet Oregon road,<br>
to the land she needed most<br>
Along the way, a feel of dread<br>
Inside began to rise<br>
A column of black rose ahead<br>
And stained the empty skies<br><br>

<i>It was 1.7 acres<br>
It smelled of soot now, not the sea<br>
And on the right, beside the fence<br>
Just ash â€” no old pine trees</i>
