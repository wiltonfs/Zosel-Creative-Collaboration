      <h2>Phase 2 - Katarina</h2>
      <p>
<b>Change is scary</b><br><br>

When I was young, not even ten<br>
I’d often have a cry<br>
When thinking of the years ahead<br>
And how soon they would fly<br><br>

So momma dear would hold me close<br>
And whisper in my ear<br>
Her calming words in sweet embrace<br>
That dried my every tear<br><br>

<i>Change is scary<br>
But worse is staying the same<br>
Change is scary<br>
But darling love remains</i><br><br>

So when I hit those yearly spurts<br>
Of growth and changing joys<br>
I’d wipe my nose as I packed up<br>
and put away old toys<br><br>

And with the old I’d hold the new<br>
And thank the lord above<br>
That I was here — yet again<br>
With memories to love<br><br>

<i>Change is scary<br>
But worse is staying the same<br>
Change is scary<br>
Please keep my love aflame</i><br><br>

Then one day the time had come,<br>
To move out from my home<br>
My once worst fear had now came true<br>
Yet I felt not alone<br><br>

For all the possibilities<br>
The hopes and dreams to come<br>
Outside my childhood home so dear<br>
And I found myself did hum<br><br>

<i>Change is scary<br>
But worse is staying the same<br>
Change is scary<br>
But darling love will always remain</i>
</p>
